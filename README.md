# Accelerating innovation through code
I've joined the cause, the fight to better our world with code. </br>
Even though many industries are rapidly changing, a few lag behind. </br>
My eyes are set on reshaping education. ðŸŽ“

Here on the page you'll find snippets of what projects I'm working on. </br>
No doubt I'll be testing how to change education from a variety of different technologies. </br> 
Anything from chrome-extensions to VR, I'm open to everything as long as it accelerates innovation. </br>
If you're into the concept and feel like you can help out, contact me anywhere on my socials. ðŸ“¨
