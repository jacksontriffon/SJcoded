# There's loads of developers working on stuff to change the world. 
I want to join the cause, the fight to better our world with code. 
Even though many industries are rapidly changing, a few lag behind. 
I've decided to set my focus on education. 🎓

Here on the page you'll find snippets of what projects I'm working on.
No doubt I'll be testing how to change education from a variety of different technologies. 
Anything from chrome-extensions to VR, I'm open to everything as long as it pushes humanity to learn better and faster.

It's about time we did something.
For our learning.
And our kids.
